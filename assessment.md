## Background
As a Web developer, one of the tasks you'll often be faced with is to bring a design to life, communicating with an API in order to surface the information used in the design, and providing the ability for user interaction.

With this exercise we are interested in seeing how you approach front end focused task. 

## Exercise
This task is to create a basic shop page, where individuals list the items they have for sale.(you can see an example here: https://www.nike.com/w/mens-jordan-shoes-37eefznik1zy7ok)

A simple design for this can be found here for guidance: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OYyTiHnj5tMA_gZKfQ2pGbGU3NXzrnc/view?usp=sharing>

A static API for the product data is available at: <https://5c78274f6810ec00148d0ff1.mockapi.io/api/v1/products>

### Product Requirements
- Display the list of products;
- Add a loading state
- Add functionality to show/hide sold items;
- Add functionality to like/unlike a product;
- Add a dropdown list showing the liked product as shown in the design.
- User`s liked products should remain even if user has closed the browser tab and opened another one.

### Tasks requirements
- Your React project should contain all needed setup for further development(linters, tests, etc.)
- All Acceptance criteria should be completed.
- A readme detailing how to run the project and any notes you'd like to leave.
- Your components/utils should be covered by tests.

### Tips
In a team communication is important and we like to share ideas, solutions and problems together! If you have any further questions about requirements, do not hasitate and ask them =)

Good luck and enjoy!
